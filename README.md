# SQL Projects for CoRise 

Senario - you are the General manager for the Sydney area at Airbnb. Your job is to build out and launch Airbnb in Sydney, Australia. We'll be analyzing real data from the different listings that we've onboarded so far, occupancy rates, and making decisions on how to grow the platform in the city.


## [Colab file: Exercise Week 1  ](https://github.com/sgreenley/SQL-fundamentals/blob/main/Stuart_Greenley_Week_1_Project_SQLCC.ipynb)

In this file we use SQL to help you answer questions about the Airbnb data quickly and at scale! Click the file above and let's dive a bit deeper into our current example, as the General manager for the newly-opened Airbnb Sydney.

**Week 1 goals :** 
- SQL + Databases
- Quering data: SELECT
- Filtering data : WHERE 
- Missing data: NULL values

## [Colab file: Exercise Week 2  ](https://github.com/sgreenley/SQL-fundamentals/blob/main/Stuart_Greenley_Week_2_Project_SQLCC.ipynb)

This week, we went over ways to aggregate your data and learned other intricacies of SQL. We will implement these concepts in this week's project, but as you know, with a slight twist. You are still the General Manager at Airbnb Sydney, and you'll again encounter some scenarios that you'll solve by using SQL!

**Week 2 Goals :**
- Manipulate Text
- Aggregate statistics: Group by and Having
- Use conditionals: Case statements
- Implement best practices for code readability
